    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data take an essential role in nowadays research investigations.\n",
    "Furthermore, the amount of information within data files increases.\n",
    "Despite the data that researchers produce during their own research experiments, e.g. in wetlab experiments, existing datasets will be increasingly re-used.\n",
    "Thus, researchers have to combine, pre-process, analyse, and illustrate research data as part of the research process. **(Reference)**\n",
    "This is commonly referred as data processing pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucial for the credibility of this research investigation is the detailed documentation of the process.\n",
    "This is not only valid for wetlab experiments, where so-called (electronic) lab-notebooks are used for a long time, but also for the computational analysis.\n",
    "When it comes to the latter, the naming of the involved software tools is not enough in order to make the scientific process comprehensible and reproducible.\n",
    "Furthermore, many aspects regarding the computing environment are of interest, e.g. the specific software version and the hardware/virtual environment, but also the explanation of the computational process itself is of interest, e.g. the order of the application of tools etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping the reproducibility of research investigations in mind, research software usage can be categorized into the following two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. interactive software requiring manual actions, e.g. Microsoft Excel and COMSOL Multiphysics; and \n",
    "2. parameterized software running automatically, e.g. Scripts and Batch programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While interactive software is popularly used, the interactions of the individual researchers are hard to document and, thus, also the reproducibility of the research processes is difficult to achieve.\n",
    "Thus, the second category is better suited for reproducible computational research as the re-execution of the same script in the same computing environment should obtain the same research results and findings. *(sidenote: this is not always true)*\n",
    "However, the use of this software also has to be documented in order to make the software execution comprehensible.\n",
    "This is where Jupyter notebooks came in."
